This Summer, gamers will be flocking to Canada’s LTX 2023. The fun begins July 29th in Canada at Linus Media Group’s LTX 2023 Expo. Featuring many of the biggest names in gaming tech, numerous creators, a large LAN, main stage presentations and events, and of course, Linus himself, LTX Expo is a full weekend of fun.

In prime position next to the main stage, the NVIDIA Lounge will give attendees a place to experience the GeForce RTX 4090, in addition to the latest GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, laptops, and technologies. Attendees can get hands-on with demos of the latest DLSS 3-enabled games, and newly-released NVIDIA G-SYNC Ultra Low Motion Blur 2 gaming monitors.  

The lounge is powered by ASUS, Corsair, Gigabyte, MSI and Origin PC, who have each provided systems and hardware to level up your experience.

You’ll also have the chance to meet GeForce Evangelist, Jacob Freeman, who will be on hand to answer your RTX questions, guide you through the demos and more! You’ll also find Jacob around the hall, chatting with creators and attendees - if you see him, be sure to say hi and snag a selfie.
