NVIDIA DLSS is constantly evolving, and is available today in over 330 released games and apps. Now, we’re unveiling NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, our newest innovation that enhances ray tracing with AI.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 debuts this fall in Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, and creative apps. You’ll find full details below.

Additionally, NVIDIA DLSS 3’s AI-powered performance acceleration is coming to this fall’s biggest games, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, PAYDAY 3, and Fortnite.

Introducing NVIDIA DLSS 3.5
NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 will make your games even more beautiful, immersive and realistic with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction, a new AI-powered technique that further improves the quality of ray tracing.

To ray trace games at fast frame rates, a sample of rays are fired into a scene, and hand-tuned denoisers are used to fill in missing pixels for each lighting pass.

Each hand-tuned denoiser accumulates pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. It also interpolates neighboring pixels, and blends this information together, but at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough and creating non-uniform lighting effects.

DLSS 3.5 introduces Ray Reconstruction, part of an enhanced AI-powered neural renderer that improves ray traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in-between sampled rays.

In Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, Chaos Vantage, D5 Render, and NVIDIA Omniverse, DLSS 3.5 will noticeably improve the fidelity and realism of ray-traced effects, resolving issues introduced by hand-tuned denoisers.

Take a look at the following examples from Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and D5 Render to see the benefits, and be sure to watch our new DLSS 3.5 videos from Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and Portal with RTX:

When DLSS 3.5 debuts in Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty this September, and other games and apps this fall, GeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution and DLAA.

Ray Reconstruction is a new option for developers to improve image quality for their ray-traced titles and is offered as part of DLSS 3.5. Rasterized games featuring DLSS 3.5 also include our latest updates to Super Resolution and DLAA, but will not benefit from Ray Reconstruction due to the lack of ray-traced effects.

For much more detail on Ray Reconstruction, please visit our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 explainer article, and watch our Tech Talk by Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA.

Portal with RTX Upgrades To DLSS 3.5 This Fall
Portal with RTX is our fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve’s classic game, featuring stunning path-traced visuals, the latest performance-accelerating NVIDIA technologies, and NVIDIA DLSS 3, which multiplied performance by 3X.


 
This fall, Portal with RTX upgrades to NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, making the game even more beautiful, immersive and realistic with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction, a new AI-powered technique that further improves the quality of ray tracing.

In Portal with RTX, textures are enhanced as Ray Reconstruction intelligently accumulates engine data and information across multiple frames to produce a more accurate and clear image. With existing rendering techniques, full ray tracing could struggle to resolve multiple photons of light bouncing against thin materials, like metal fences, or highly reflective surfaces. This could cause excessive shimmering on thin surfaces and light instability or “boiling” on reflective walls. But with DLSS 3.5’s Ray Reconstruction technology, each fence appears stable no matter how much light is illuminating the thinnest of its meshes.

Lights and reflections update faster and more accurately, too and each crevice in every room is lit with clarity, making the test chambers of Aperture Laboratories look as they would in the real world.


 
Ray Reconstruction will be available for all GeForce RTX users - get the complete lowdown in our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 announcement article. And catch it on GeForce NOW to stream it from the cloud if you don’t have a game-ready device.
