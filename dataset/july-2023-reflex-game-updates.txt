Portal: Prelude RTX Available Now, For Free!
Portal remains a timeless classic; in December we released Portal with RTX, a fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve’s award winning game, which used the performance multiplication of NVIDIA DLSS 3 to power the most realistic path-traced lighting ever seen in a real-time game. Now, there’s Portal: Prelude RTX, a free mod remastered with the same technology, featuring fully ray traced (path-traced) graphics, DLSS 3, Reflex, and our new NVIDIA RTX IO GPU-accelerated storage tech.

Portal: Prelude is the highest rated Portal mod, the 2008 Portal ModDB winner, and #3 overall Player’s Choice mod of 2008. Created by Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet and others, Portal: Prelude is an unofficial Portal prequel, set before the time of GLaDOS, featuring a new extremely challenging 8-10 hour campaign composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, a fully voiced story with NPCs, and a whole lot more.

Portal: Prelude RTX is available now, for free for owners of Portal. Install our new Game Ready Driver for the definitive experience, then download and play Portal: Prelude RTX from Steam.
