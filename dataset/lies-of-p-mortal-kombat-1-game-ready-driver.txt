Lies of P Launches September 19th With DLSS 2
Inspired by the familiar story of Pinocchio, Lies of P is an action Souls-like game set in the dark, Belle Époque-inspired city of Krat. Once a beautiful city, Krat has become a living nightmare as deadly puppets run amok and a plague sweeps the land. Play as P, a puppet who must fight his way through the city on his unrelenting journey to find Geppetto and finally become human. Lies of P presents an elegant world filled with tension, deep combat and character customization systems, and a gripping story with interesting narrative choices where the more lies told, the more human P becomes.


 
When Lies of P launches on September 19th, GeForce RTX gamers can significantly accelerate their performance - in our GeForce RTX 40 Series benchmarks, frame rates increased by an average of 1.9X at 4K with max settings enabled.

Game Ready For Mortal Kombat 1
Liu Kang has restarted history, crafting a New Era reflecting his vision of peace. Meanwhile Mileena, twin sister of Kitana and rightful heir to Outworld's throne, has been infected by a dreaded and lethal disease. Lin Kuei warriors and brothers Scorpion and Sub-Zero fight for the future of the clan, while Earthrealm champions Raiden and Kung Lao fight for family and honor. Johnny Cage, who is more concerned with staying relevant in the eyes of his fans, fights for his own vanity. Fight your way through the new Universe of Mortal Kombat 1, ushering in a new era of the iconic franchise with a new fighting system, game modes, and new, spectacular fatalities.


 
At launch, DLSS 2 Super Resolution will be available to ensure GeForce RTX gamers hit a locked 60 frames per second in every match, with every setting maxed out at 1440p and 4K.

Starfield Performance Improvements
Today, NVIDIA is releasing a Resizable BAR profile for Starfield which increases performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series and GeForce RTX 30 Series desktop and laptop GPUs. In our testing scenario, GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop GPUs see on average a 5% increase in performance. The Starfield Resizable BAR update will be pushed via an Over-The-Air (OTA) update from NVIDIA and will be automatically applied for gamers running the latest Game Ready Driver (537.34) or the previous release (537.17).
