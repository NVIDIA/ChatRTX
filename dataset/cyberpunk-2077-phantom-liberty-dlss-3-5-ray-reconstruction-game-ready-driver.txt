DLSS 3.5 & Ray Reconstruction Debut Today In Cyberpunk 2077
Today, September 21st, Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.0 update launches with tons of enhancements, including DLSS 3.5. In Cyberpunk 2077’s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5’s new Ray Reconstruction technique improves the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.


 
GeForce RTX 40 Series users can benefit from all the performance and image quality enhancements that DLSS 3.5 has to offer - including performance-multiplying Frame Generation for the fastest frame rates - in the demanding Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.

And on September 26th, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty launches with full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, and Ray Reconstruction. Phantom Liberty is a new spy-thriller adventure for Cyberpunk 2077. When the orbital shuttle of the President of the New United States of America is shot down over the deadliest district of Night City, there’s only one person who can save her — you. Become V, a cyberpunk for hire, and dive deep into a tangled web of espionage and political intrigue, unraveling a story that connects the highest echelons of power with the brutal world of black-market mercenaries.
