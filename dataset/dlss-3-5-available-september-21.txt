NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 debuts in Cyberpunk 2077 and Chaos Vantage.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 makes your games even more beautiful, immersive and realistic with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction, a new AI-powered technique that further enhances the quality of ray tracing. And in apps, ray-traced previews and viewports are greatly improved, enabling creators to better visualize the final result before time-consuming renders.

DLSS 3.5 is available for all GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX users; for the complete breakdown on this new technology, head to our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 announcement article.

In other DLSS news, Lies of P, Party Animals, Warhaven and Witchfire are all launching this week with day-one DLSS support, and gamers can check out an open beta for The First Descendant, an upcoming DLSS 3-accelerated game.

In each game, GeForce RTX users will receive the definitive experience - read on for all the details.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 Launches Today
NVIDIA is advancing rendering technology once more with the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, which is a new AI model that enhances ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.

Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned denoisers, which resolve sampled rays in a scene, with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.

Hand-tuned denoisers accumulate pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. They also interpolate neighboring pixels, and blend this information together, at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough, and creating non-uniform lighting effects.

Upscaling is the last stage of the ray-traced lighting pipeline, and is key to experiencing the most detailed and demanding games at fast frame rates. But with denoising removing or decreasing the quality of effects, the limitations of hand-tuned denoisers are amplified, removing fine detail (referred to as high-frequency information) that upscalers use to output a crisp, clean image.

Trained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, DLSS 3.5 recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling.

Using training derived from the analysis of offline-rendered images, which require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, Ray Reconstruction recognizes lighting patterns from training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game as you play. The results are superior to using hand-tuned denoisers.


 
In Portal with RTX, with DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles with spatial interpolation, where it’s not blending enough pixels, creating a blotchy effect. Additionally, it’s not accumulating enough good pixels from previous frames, and the result is a boiling effect in the light. With DLSS 3.5, it recognizes certain patterns associated with reflections and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high quality reflections.


 
In the following scene from Cyberpunk 2077, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.

The streets of Cyberpunk 2077’s Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is vastly improved city wide:

With DLSS 3.5, we’re delivering a faster, better experience as a free upgrade, building upon the much-loved enhancements already available in your favorite games and most used apps. 

Cyberpunk 2077 Upgrades To DLSS 3.5
Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.0 update is available now with tons of enhancements, including DLSS 3.5. In Cyberpunk 2077’s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5’s new Ray Reconstruction technique improves the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.


 
GeForce RTX 40 Series users can benefit from all the performance and image quality enhancements that DLSS 3.5 has to offer - including performance-multiplying Frame Generation for the fastest frame rates - in the demanding Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.

And on September 26th, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty launches with full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, and Ray Reconstruction. Phantom Liberty is a new spy-thriller adventure for Cyberpunk 2077. When the orbital shuttle of the President of the New United States of America is shot down over the deadliest district of Night City, there’s only one person who can save her — you. Become V, a cyberpunk for hire, and dive deep into a tangled web of espionage and political intrigue, unraveling a story that connects the highest echelons of power with the brutal world of black-market mercenaries.


 
"Thanks to DLSS 3.5’s smart technology, fuelled by AI rendering power, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty’s newest location Dogtown at its very best — with sharper images, more accurate lighting, and the highest frame rates possible." - Jakub Knapik, VP of Art, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED

Thanks to DLSS 3.5 and the leading full ray tracing performance of GeForce RTX, the definitive way to experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is on a GeForce RTX graphics card, PC or laptop.

DLSS 3.5 For Creators: Chaos Vantage Upgrades Today, NVIDIA Omniverse This October
Creative platforms and applications have a wide variety of content that is difficult for traditional denoisers as they require hand-tuning per scene. As a result, when previewing content you get suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network is able to recognize a wide variety of scenes, producing high quality images during preview, before committing a long time for a final render.

The benefit of Ray Reconstruction is particularly noticeable while navigating the viewport, as rendering during camera movement is notoriously difficult. But Ray Reconstruction enables sharper images with significantly reduced noise while panning around a scene, improving the real-time editing experience and allowing creators to share their work with clients and collaborators.

Chaos Vantage is a popular 3D visualization tool enabling creators to explore large scenes in a fully ray-traced environment. Vantage, which is already accelerated on RTX GPUs with NVIDIA’s OptiX denoiser and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, adds support for Ray Reconstruction to provide further enhancements to image quality, providing a massive boost for creators navigating complex scenes.


Additionally, NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer, a fully customizable app for OpenUSD world-building that allows users to assemble, light, simulate, and render large scale scenes, will be upgrading to DLSS 3.5 in October.
