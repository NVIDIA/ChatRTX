Portal remains a timeless classic; in December we released Portal with RTX, a fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve’s award winning game, which used the performance multiplication of NVIDIA DLSS 3 to power the most realistic path-traced lighting ever seen in a real-time game.

Portal with RTX was created using NVIDIA RTX Remix, a free, upcoming modding platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables modders to quickly create and share #RTXON mods for classic games, each with enhanced materials, full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex.

Now, RTX Remix has been used to remaster Portal: Prelude, the highest rated Portal mod, the 2008 Portal ModDB winner, and #3 overall Player’s Choice mod of 2008. Created by Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet and others, Portal: Prelude is an unofficial Portal prequel, set before the time of GLaDOS, featuring a new extremely challenging 8-10 hour campaign composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, a fully voiced story with NPCs, and a whole lot more.

Portal: Prelude RTX is available today to download from Steam, for free!


 
Portal: Prelude RTX is remastered with full ray tracing (also known as path tracing), DLSS 3, Reflex and the newly-launched NVIDIA RTX IO to deliver an even more immersive experience for gamers. It also features hundreds of new, fully upgraded materials and assets from David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm and Valerios “Fearell_Val” Tsoumpas, new voice acting by Jack “Amicus” McDade and Colin “SordidSpectacle” Zachariasen, and gameplay improvements from Nicolas. Portal: Prelude RTX is the definitive way to play the award winning mod.

Introducing Portal: Prelude RTX
If you’ve played Portal with RTX, you already know about the game’s immersive fully ray-traced (path traced) lighting, its remade materials and models, and its incredible visuals that offer a preview of how all games will look in the future. 

Portal: Prelude RTX is even more spectacular. And its technology even more advanced.

During the course of Portal: Prelude’s story, players will encounter extremely challenging, advanced test chambers with more varied sights that with the power of RTX could well drop your jaw. Multiple layers of glass refract light, players move from complete darkness to bright locations, and dangerous hazards like particle disintegrators illuminate the world in deadly light, leveraging RTX to create memorable moments.

200 new materials and textures, and 100 new models mesh perfectly with Portal with RTX’s remade assets, adding extra variety to test chambers and challenges. And more advanced geometry -that pushed the boundaries of the Source engine in 2008- enables more varied and aesthetically interesting uses of light and shadow. For Portal: Prelude RTX, geometry was updated and upgraded in standard Half-Life Engine tools (Valve Hammer Editor), before being imported and automatically supported by RTX Remix, enabling fast iteration and development. Ultimately, this gorgeous remaster was created by a team of five in eight short months.


Portal: Prelude’s inclusion of NPC characters posed new challenges, requiring the development of an exciting feature for RTX Remix: full support for skinned characters. Now, in any game with GPU skinning, Remix enables modders to add more than 100 times the polygonal detail to characters, in addition to high fidelity PBR textures, with minimal performance costs. Essentially, characters and animated/skinned props can be enhanced in the same way as any object in RTX Remix, benefiting all future RTX mods. Or in other words, RTX Remix is revolutionizing character replacements and upgrades in the same way it revolutionized asset replacement.


For Portal: Prelude RTX and future NVIDIA RTX Remix mods, the NVIDIA RTX Path Tracing SDK has been enhanced, improving denoiser performance and quality, which is particularly beneficial at lower resolutions, enabling gamers with older GeForce RTX GPUs to have a better experience.

Shader Execution Reordering (SER) dynamically reorganizes inefficient ray tracing workloads into considerably more efficient ones, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series performance.

Opacity Micro Meshes (OMM) increase real-time performance and memory compression for complex geometry, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series ray tracing performance, and with new CPU optimizations debuting in Portal: Prelude RTX, players receive even faster performance.

And of course, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and NVIDIA Reflex have both been upgraded to their newest versions for improved performance, even better image quality, and more responsive gameplay.


All of the enhancements, additions and improvements created for Portal: Prelude RTX will be incorporated into NVIDIA RTX Remix, benefitting all modders, and enabling superior updates to classic games. In the near future, NVIDIA will begin sharing early access versions of RTX Remix with select modders to further refine the creator toolkit and runtime ahead of its official release later this year. Stay tuned for updates.

NVIDIA RTX IO Makes Its Debut, Accelerating Texture Loading Times & Reducing File Sizes
Rapid loading and smooth navigation through endless open worlds has long been a goal of gamers and developers alike. Even with the incredible performance of NVMe SSDs, this goal has remained out of reach. Modern game engines have exceeded the capability of traditional storage APIs; a new generation of Input/Output (IO) architecture is needed.

Enter NVIDIA RTX IO, enabling fast GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, massively accelerating IO performance compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs. NVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU decompression for smaller data packages, enabling faster texture load times and lower CPU utilization, and allows developers to create a new generation of games with massive highly detailed worlds. 

NVIDIA RTX IO makes its debut alongside the free Portal: Prelude RTX mod today, and will also feature in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th.

In Portal: Prelude RTX, NVIDIA RTX IO is always on (you don’t need to toggle it in a menu) and it enables much faster texture load time, minimizing asset pop-in:


 

NVIDIA RTX IO also lowers Portal: Prelude RTX’s texture package install size by 44%, enabling gamers to enjoy nearly 32 GB of 4K textures loaded with lossless detail, while only taking up 18 GB of storage space. When the RTX Remix creator toolkit is released, every modder will be able to count on RTX IO to enable them to stay true to their artistic vision, while keeping within the file size restrictions of popular modding sites.
